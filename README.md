# Case Study: AnySphere and Cursor
## Overview of AnySphere
 
 * Name of company: AnySphere Inc.
 
 * When was AnySphere incorporated? The company was incorporated in 2022.
 
 * Who are the founders of AnySphere? AnySphere was founded by Michael Truell, Sualeh Asif, Arvid Lunnemark, and Aman Sanger while they were students at MIT.
 
 * How did the idea for AnySphere (or project) come about? The idea for curser started when the founders saw that there was a need for a more efficient way to write code quickly and accurately. They saw that with the sudden increase in the quality and amount of AI models there was also a way to incorporate it into the coding process.
 
 * How is AnySphere funded? How much funding have they received? Anysphere was initally funded through a seed round in june of last year. They were able to raise $11 million initially. The last round if fyunding in August of this year brought AnySphere's valuation to $400 million.

## Business Activities
 
 * What specific problem is AnySphere or project trying to solve? AnySphere is trying to solve the problem of the cognitive load on developers. They are trying to make the coding process more efficient and accurate by removing many of the repetative tasks.There repetitive tasks include things like debugging, writing comments, and writing documentation.
 
 * Who is AnySphere's intended customer? AnySphere is targeting Software Engineers/Developers from large companies to individual programmers.
 
 * What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? AnySphere offers a code editor that is powered by AI. This code editor is able to understand natural language and help the developer write code faster and more accurately.
 
 * Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? AnySphere is currently using large language models to power their code editor. They are also using machine learning algorithms to help the code editor understand the codebase and make suggestions.


## Landscape

* What field is AnySphere in? AnySphere is supporting Software Development.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? There has been a large increase in the number of AI models that are being created. With that increase there are more chances to incorporate AI into software development making it more efficient.

* What are the other major companies in this field? GitHub, Tabnine, and Amazon CodeWhisperer are the other major companies in this field.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of AnySphere so far? On a personal level I have been using their product Cursor and it has been a game changer. It has allowed me to write code much faster. It is making iot so taht one developer can do the work of 3 or even 4 developers. I believe that it is makingit so that if you do not learn to do AI assited coding you will not have a job in software development.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? As this is a new field there are not many core metrics to use. The most impactful one that I have found is the amount of money that tey are able to raise. 

* How is AnySphere performing relative to competitors in the same field? AnySphere is performing very well. They have a large user base and are seeing a lot of success. Most of this is due to their uniquie features. It specialzes in multiline code completions and codebase knowledge integration.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise AnySphere, what products or services would you suggest they offer? A product/service that would be extremely helpful would be better history management. After prolioged use the history begins to lag the process down. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit AnySphere? If they were able to offer a history manager that could still keep the history but make it less computing intensive they would have a product that was top of the line. This would put them far ahead of GitHub, Copilot, and Tabnine.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? They would need to utilize natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to consolidate the history. It would also be nice if they could make it so that it could read the whole codebase every once in a while. It could store a version of the codebase and then use that to help with the history.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? These technologies are appropriate for this solution because they will allow the history manager to understand the conversation and provide more accurate suggestions.
